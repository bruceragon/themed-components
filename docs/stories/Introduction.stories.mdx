# themed-components
**note**: this library is still under development (WIP)

An extensible and themeable React component library based on [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [styled-icons](https://styled-icons.js.org/).

## Theming

use the ThemeProvider component (a wrapper around styled-components' ThemeProvider) to apply a theme to all its descendants:
```jsx
<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  {/* ...children */}
</ThemeProvider>
```
the Theme object extends Styled System's Theme definition with: 
- a "global" key for global styles applied to the body of the page
- a "fontFaces" key that allows to define fontFaces in the theme (to avoid blinking fonts on re-renders add: "font-display: fallback" to your font face definition)

it also applies a set of rules from Normalize CSS

### Primitives

The library is composed of a set of "primitive" components that corresponds to basic HTML elements (Link for anchors, Input for inputs etc...).

These primitives are all Theme aware components, which styles can be defined in a theme file under the corresponding scale (see styled system's [theme specification](https://styled-system.com/theme-specification)).

The scale for a primitive is the plural of the component's name (input > inputs, link > links, ...) 

All the other components are built on top of primitives which allows them to also be theme aware and to accept styled system props. 

### Styled System props

See styled system's props [reference table](https://styled-system.com/table).

All components accept a set of those props (as shown in the documentation page of each component).

### using styled-components classes in theme file:

As shown in the theme definition examples, you can use styled components classes to define variants like so:
```ts
// my-theme.ts
import { Link  } from "@themed-components/core"
// ...
lists: {
    primary: {
        [Link + ":hover"]: {
            color: "secondary"
        }
    }
}
```
#### exceptions
(as of now *icons* in *IconInput* and *containers* in *Select*)

**note:** the following is most likely going to change in a future release to match the behaviour described above.

Due to the way some components are implemented, for example with absolute positioning or with Portals, it's not always possible to do things like: 
```ts
// my-theme.ts
import { Icon  } from "@themed-components/core"
// The following won't work, because in the DOM tree Icon is not a descendant of Input
inputs: {
    primary: {
        [Icon + ":hover"]: {
            color: "secondary"
        }
    }
}
```
Instead, a component that composes a primitive can override the default scale and also pass it the parent's variant as a prop.

Consider the following example from the IconInput component (simplified for the example):
```tsx
function IconInput(props: IconInputProps) {
  const {icon, variant, ...inputProps} = props;
  // ...
  return (
    <CustomInput {...inputProps} ref={forwardedRef}>
      {children}
      {icon &&
          <Icon
              variant={inputScale + iconScale + variant}
              iconType={icon}
              ref={iconContainerRef}
          />
      }
    </CustomInput>
  )
}
```
(nb: CustomInput is a component that composes the Input component, creates an absolute div on top 
of it and injects the children in it. So in CSS terms Icon is not a child of Input, 
as input elements cannot have children).


As a result of passing the variant prop to the Icon component as: 
```variant={inputScale + iconScale + variant}```
the icon gets the following variant: "inputs.icons.primary"
meaning that you can define it like so in the theme file:
```ts
// my-theme.ts
inputs: {
    primary: {
      border: 1px solid;
      borderColor: primary; // works if you defined a primary color in the colors' scale
    }
    icons: {
      primary: {
        color: secondary
      }
    }
},
// this is particularly useful if the primary icons outside of inputs have a CSS that doesn't match:
icons: {
  primary: {
    color: primary
  }
}  
```
